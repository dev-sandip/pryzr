      "condition": { "demandScore": { "gt": 80 } },
      "adjustment": { "type": "multiply", "value": 1.15 },
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "inventory",
      "condition": { "stockRatio": { "lt": 0.3 } },
      "adjustment": { "type": "multiply", "value": 1.25 },
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "weights": {
    "demand": 0.3,
    "inventory": 0.25,
    "competitor": 0.25,
    "time": 0.1,
    "customer": 0.1
  },
  "constraints": {
    "minimumPrice": 10.00,
    "maximumPrice": 500.00,
    "maxChangePercent": 20
  }
}
